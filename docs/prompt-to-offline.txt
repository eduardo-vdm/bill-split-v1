Implement offline functionality for the Bill Split app by:

1. Creating and registering a service worker that:
   - Caches all static assets (HTML, CSS, JS, images, fonts)
   - Uses Cache-First strategy for static assets
   - Handles installation and activation events
   - Location: /public/service-worker.js

2. Adding PWA features:
   - Create web app manifest at /public/manifest.json with:
     - App name: "Bill Split"
     - Short name: "BillSplit"
     - Description: "Split bills with friends"
     - Theme color: #3B82F6 (primary-500)
     - Background color: #FFFFFF
     - Icons: 192x192 and 512x512 (use existing app icon)
     - Start URL: "/"
     - Display: "standalone"
   - Add meta tags in index.html for PWA support
   - Add install prompt handling

3. Modifying the build process:
   - Generate asset manifest for service worker
   - Ensure proper caching headers
   - Add workbox-webpack-plugin configuration

4. Testing requirements:
   - Verify app loads without network
   - Check all features work offline
   - Validate PWA installation
   - Test on different devices

Note: No backend sync needed as app uses localStorage exclusively.
